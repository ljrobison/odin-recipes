      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <h3>MAKE THE MEAT FILLING:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for
          2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart
          with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and
          pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned,
          stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1
          minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no
          clumps of tomato paste remain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the
          liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring
          occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>MAKE THE POTATO TOPPING:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water.
          Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are
          fork tender, 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot.
          Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any
          remaining liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the
          potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>ASSEMBLE THE CASSEROLE:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it
          out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat.
          Carefully spread into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet
          so that the filling does not bubble over into your oven. Bake
          uncovered for 25-30 minutes.** Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
